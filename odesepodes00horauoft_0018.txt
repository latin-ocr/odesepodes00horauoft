Sonted at the Sit-oc when it breves

Tho battle with the Ion-ian waves,

The man of traffie lauda his eane

And native hnmlet’s rus-al lens,

Then does his shataer'd barke περαίη

Ill school’d his penury to bear.

A man there is, who neither horna

of the time-mellow’d Mansio acorna,

Nor e'en a portion to purloin

From the whole day—with limbs supine,
Stmtch'd now some arbuta green below ;
Now at some fount. with gentle flow

Of hnllow'd streamlet. Many a wight
The tented field and blant delight

of trump with clm-ion blant, and ruys
Loathed of motbem. Stin them-e mys
Beneath the freezing open sky

The huntaman, losing memor-y

Of his εοῆ consort ; whether doe

By his stanch hounds is apied, or through
His fllmy toils a Mat-sinn bon·

of lore-eron'd brown, the ivy spx-ny,
With Gods supreme amdam ς me
0001 grove, and beviee lightly tripping
Of Nympha with Satyrs, fn· m koeping

Neither Ekxterpe chains u mute,
